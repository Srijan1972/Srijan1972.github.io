I am a master's student at NYU Tandon broadly interested in the area of computer engineering and microelectronics.

I did my undergraduate studies at IIT Delhi, where I published the thesis [Combining Heterogeneous Compute Platforms](/assets/docs/IITD_Thesis.pdf) under the supervision of [Prof. Kolin Paul](https://kolinpaul.github.io/).
